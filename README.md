Description:

Major airlines companies that provide passenger services keep databases with lots of
information on all airlines.

 Each airline has an identification number, name and address, name of the contact person and
telephone numbers.

 Each employee who works in Airline Company has an employee identification number, name,
address, birthday recorded as (day, month, year), gender, position with the company, and
qualifications.

 Each airline owns different aircraft models. For each aircraft an aircraft identification number,
capacity, and model are recorded.

 The aircraft are assigned to different routes. An aircraft can work on more than one route and a
route has many aircraft going on it. Some information such as number of passengers, price per
passenger, departure date time, arrival date time and the time that aircraft spent in traveling
the route are recorded.

 Each route has a route identification number, origin, destination, distance, classification (e.g.
domestic or international route).

 Each aircraft has its own crew (major pilot, assistant pilot and two hostesses), the aircraft crew
not stored as employees.

 Each airline keeps information about their buy/sell transactions (for example selling an airplane
ticket is a sell transaction, paying for maintenance is a buy transaction). Each transaction has
a transaction identification number, date, description, and amount of money paid/received.

 Each passenger is identified by a unique Passenger ID, and the following details are recorded:
Name, Address, Contact Number, Email. Passengers are linked to transactions. Each
transaction is associated with a specific Passenger, ensuring that ticket purchases or other
transactions can be tracked back to the individual passenger.
